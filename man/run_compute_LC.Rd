}
\arguments{
\item{ID}{vector of ID area}

\item{p}{numeric, vector of probabilities}

\item{bound_min}{numeric, minimum of the interval}

\item{bound_max}{numeric, maximum of the interval}

\item{nb}{numeric, number of the interval}

\item{method}{string, type of methods ("CondExp" for conditional expectation method of "Midpoint" for midpoint method)}

\item{whichpareto}{numeric, probability from which pareto tail is assumed}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the bounds, the means, the cumulative income shares and the cumulative population shares.
